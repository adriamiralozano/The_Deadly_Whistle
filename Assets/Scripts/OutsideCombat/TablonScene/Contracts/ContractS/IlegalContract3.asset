  Title: Marshall
  Description: 'Description: Wanted for egregious abuse of power, widespread corruption,
    and the unlawful persecution of innocent citizens. Once a symbol of law and order,
    this treacherous figure has twisted justice to serve their own ruthless agenda,
    framing honest folk and eliminating anyone who stands in their way. Armed with
    both a badge and a deadly aim, they are a formidable and dangerous foe who knows
    how to exploit every loophole in the law.'
